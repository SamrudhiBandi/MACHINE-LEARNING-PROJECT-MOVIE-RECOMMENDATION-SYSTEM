# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
In todayâ€™s era of digital streaming, recommendation systems play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by helping users discover relevant content tailored to their preferences. This project focuses on building a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a given title by analyzing their attributes.

Overview
This system utilizes machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie features such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overviews. By transforming this textual information into numerical vectors, the system computes the cosine similarity between movies and recommends the top 5 most similar ones.

Built using Python and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK, the system is trained on publicly available datasets like the TMDB Movie Metadata from Kaggle.
This project highlights the power of machine learning in delivering personalized experiences and mirrors real-world applications seen in platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and IMDb.

Project Workflow

Step 1: Data Collection
Use datasets TMDB.

Common columns: title, overview, genres, cast, crew, keywords

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Merge key features into a single text field called tags

Extract and clean textual data (e.g., actor names, director, genres)

Apply standard NLP steps: lowercasing, removal of stopwords, stemming

Step 3: Vectorization
Convert processed text into numerical vectors using:

CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words model)

or TfidfVectorizer (to consider term importance)

Step 4: Similarity Calculation
Calculate cosine similarity between movie vectors

Generate a similarity matrix to identify related movies

Step 5: Recommendation Engine
Input: Movie title from the user

Process:

Locate the movie index

Fetch similarity scores from the matrix

Sort and return the top 5 most similar movies
